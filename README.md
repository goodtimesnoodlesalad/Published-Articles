<strong>The Flyover</strong>
<a href=http://theflyover.net>The Flyover</a> is "a blog about cities that aren't New York," aka a collection of essays loosely related to the Midwest and other "flyover" parts of the United States and/or by Midwestern writers. Together with <a href="http://lukeandrewgeddes.com">Luke Geddes</a>, I launched this site in September 2015.
